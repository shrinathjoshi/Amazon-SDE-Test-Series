You are given an integer N. You need to convert all zeroes of N to 5.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number.

Output:
For each test case, there will be a new line containing an integer where all zero's are converted to 5.

Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function convertFive() which takes an integer N as an argument and replaces all zeros in the number N with 5. Your function should return the converted number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(K) where K is the number of digits in N
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= n <= 10000

Example:
Sample Input:
2
1004
121

Sample Output:
1554
121

Explanation:
Test Case 1: There are two zeroes in "1004", on replacing all zeroes with "5", the new number will be "1554".
Test Case 2: Since there are no zeroes in "121", the number remains as "121".


int convertFive(int n) {
    
//Approach One
    int power=1;
    int remainder=0;
    int ans=0;
    while(n!=0)
    {
        remainder=n%10;
        n=n/10;
        if(remainder==0)
            remainder=5;
        
        ans=ans+remainder*power;
        power=power*10;
    }    
    return ans;
    
    //Second Approach
    /*
    string s=to_string(n);
    for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++)
    {    if(s[i]=='0')
                s[i]='5';
    }
    return stoi(s);
    
    */
}
